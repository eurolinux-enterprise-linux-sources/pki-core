/**
 * Represents a set of publishing rules. Publishing rules are ordered from
 * lowest priority to highest priority. The priority assignment for publishing 
 * rules is not enforced by this interface. Various implementation may
 * use different mechanisms such as a linear ordering of publishing rules
 * in a configuration file or explicit assignment of priority levels ..etc.
 * The publishing rule initialization needs to deal with reading the 
 * publishing rules, sorting them in increasing order of priority and 
 * presenting an ordered vector of publishing rules via the IPublishRuleSet 
 * interface.
 * When a request comes, the predicates of the publishing rules will be 
 * checked in the order to find the first matched publishing rule as the 
 * mapping rule to (un)publish the object.
