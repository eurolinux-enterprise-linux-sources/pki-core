/**
 * The RequestStatus class represents the current state of a request
 * in a request queue.  The state of the request changes as actions
 * are performed on it.
 *
 * The request is created in the BEGIN state, then general progresses
 * through the PENDING, APPROVED, SVC_PENDING, and COMPLETE states.
 * Some requests may bypass the PENDING state if no agent action is
 * required.
 *
 * Requests may be CANCELED (not implemented) or REJECTED.  These are
 * error conditions, and usually result because the request was invalid
 * or was not approved by an agent.
